# advent-of-code

These are my Advent of Code submissions. They are not necessarily the best or fastest solutions but just the unmodified versions of what I wrote during the contest itself.

You can join my discord server, [The Particle Collider](https://discord.gg/j9uunTRRJm).

I upload my solutions and walk-throughs on my YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino. Feel free to follow me on Twitch too; I might stream in the future! https://twitch.tv/HyperNeutrino.
